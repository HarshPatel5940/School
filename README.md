A Repository to keep a track of my School projects


My Old Repository was deleted cause it had 180 commits and various commits conatining *important tokents & data* which was becoming harder to maintain. 
So I decided to make seperate repo for all my projects which will also help me in keeping track of projects seprately in a clean way.
