Participating in a quiz can be fun as it provides a competitive element. Some educational institutes use it as a tool to measure knowledge level, abilities and/or skills of their pupils either on a general level
or in a specific field of study. Identify and analyse
popular quiz shows and write a Python program to
create a quiz that should also contain the following
functionalities besides the one identified by you as
a result of your analysis.
• Create an administrative user ID and password
to categorically add, modify, delete a question
• Register the student before allowing her or him
to play a quiz
• Allow selection of category based on subject area
• Display questions as per the chosen category
• Keep the score as the participant plays
• Display the final score
