"""
    => For God Sake don't hesitate to use multi line strings
    
    => Colored Text ( from termcolor import colored, cprint )
    
    => invoking terminal for color text to work in terminal ()

        system("")
        
    => carriage return (\r) with end=""
        carriage return is good in certain scenarios but makes problem in terminal (output mode completely fine)
        when the replacing string is shorter than exsisting string
        
    => os.system("cls") invoke terminal commands which can help to clear screen after a fnc completed
    

    ============================== Useless story ===============================
    *cough*  did not knew what to do and i was not satisfied with "\n method" and 
    i thought using multi line stings will not be that good but *ah ah* it did help \100 times
    it helped a lot in cleaning out my code and now i don;t hesitate to use multi-line strings

file Opening Modes : r  w  a  w+  a+  ab  wb  ab+  wb+

General Methods:
    open()                        used to open the file
    with open <file >as <variable>:    used to automatically close the file when out
    .close()                      used to close the file
    .read()                       used to read whole file
    .readline()                   used to read and return a single line
    .readlines()                  used to read and get multiple lines in a list
    .writeline()                  used to write a single line
    .writelines()                 used to write multiple lines with new line character (\n)
    .flush()                      to ensure the data is saved

Binary: (import pickle)
    .dump()                       used to convert txt to dat 
    .load()                       used to convert dat to txt

csv: (import csv)

    .writerows(list_row)           used to write multiple rows using nested list

example :

# Functions, error handling & Importing
"""
Importing:
    import <module>                     used to import whole module
    from <module> import <function>     used to import specific functions from the module
    <module/function> as <var>          used to give aliases name to the module or functions

Functions:
    fnc_name = keep any function name you want

        def <fnc_name>(parameters):      used to define any function with parameters
        <fnc_name>(arguments)            used to Call Your Function with arguements

        return a                         used to return a single line value
        return a,b                       used to return multiple values

    from <filename> import <function>    Used to import functions from a specific file 
    from file import <function> as <var> used to give aliases name to the module or functions
    from file import fnc1, fnc2 , fnc3   used to import multiple functions

Error Handling:
    We can reduce Most of the errors by error handling one of the common error handlers are try/except

    try:
        ur code block                   # try executing code
    except <error>:
        do the necessary things          # if "try" code causes error instead of raising it do this code

    Note : if you don't specify <error> in except then it will consider all errors for it

# LIST
"""
Methods:
